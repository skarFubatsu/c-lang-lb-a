Programming Assignment: Implementing a Grocery Billing System

## Objective

To consolidate your understanding of basic I/O operations, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and logical operators in C programming.

## Background

Consider a local grocery store. Customers come in, pick up items, and then proceed to the billing counter. The cashier at the counter needs to calculate the total bill for each customer.

## Task

### Program 1: Greet the customer

Print a welcome message for the customer.

Example: "Welcome to XYZ Grocery Store!"

### Program 2: Input the price and quantity for three items

Ask the user to input the price and quantity for three grocery items.

Calculate the total price for each item (price * quantity).

Calculate and display the sum of all items.

### Program 3: Apply discounts based on the total bill

If the total bill amount is more than Rs 100, give a discount of 10%.

If the total bill amount is between Rs 50 and Rs 100, give a discount of 5%.

Use all types of operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, etc.) where applicable in your logic.

Display the total amount, the discount applied, and the final amount to be paid.

### Program 4: Check for membership

Ask the customer if they have a membership card.

If yes, give an additional 5% discount on the final amount.

Display the total amount after the membership discount (if any).

### Program 5: Check if today's date is a leap year or not

Input today's date from the user.

Check and display if the current year is a leap year or not using the logic you learned.
